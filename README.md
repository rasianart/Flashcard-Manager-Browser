# Flashcard-Generator (Browser Version) (1.0)

Flashcard-Generator is a streamlined and intuitive process of creating, storing, and reading digital flashcards.

Flashcard-Generator utilizes two methods of reading/storing: basic and cloze-delete

Basic cards operate with a front/back method.  The front contains the complete question.  The back contains the answer.

Cloze-deleted cards operated with a partial display method.  The answer is ommitted from the card statement and replaced with "..."

3 Focal Pathways:

1. Create 
2. Read
3. Random

"Create" will direct user to create either a basic or cloze-deleted flashcard.  If cloze-deleted is chosen, the user with input the flashcard statement with the answer encapsulated by  "(  )".  After each creation, the user will be prompted to save the flashcard in a database.

"Read" will direct the user to either choose a random flashcard from the database to be read, or search the database with key terms.  The user may select to read from either a basic card directory or a cloze-deleted directory.

"Random" will select a random flashcard from an online Jeopary API and read it to the user.  The user then has the option to save this flashcard to the database.
